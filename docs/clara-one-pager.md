# Clara: Universal Keys for Universal Code

## The Thesis

**Keys should be as universal as code.**

---

## The Shift

The interface is changing. Users are moving from app-specific frontends to their own AI-powered clients. You don't go to a website—your assistant goes for you.

This breaks wallets. Browser extensions assume a browser. Hardware wallets assume a specific device. Keys are trapped in contexts that are disappearing.

When users interact with blockchains through *their own clients*, keys need to travel with them.

---

## The Convergence

**Claude Code** is becoming the universal interface for developers. Write code, deploy contracts, interact with APIs—all through conversation, from anywhere.

**Para** is building universal key infrastructure. MPC means no private key file. No seed phrase. No local storage. Keys exist in computation, not on a device.

Together: **keys that are wherever you are.**

## Clara

A wallet for Claude Code, powered by Para.

- **Natural language transactions** — "Send 0.1 ETH to vitalik.eth"
- **Multi-chain native** — EVM and Solana, same identity
- **No key management** — MPC handles security
- **Context-aware** — Claude understands what it's signing

---

## Why Now

Crypto assumed users would come to apps. AI flips this—apps come to users through their assistant.

Clara is the first wallet built for this shift. Not a browser extension. Not an app. A capability that lives where the user already is.

*Built on Para's MPC infrastructure. No private keys exposed to clients.*
